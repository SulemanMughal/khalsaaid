Khalsa Aid International first visited the region in January 2018, following reports of up to a million Congolese men, women and children fleeing their homes, seeking safety in neighbouring countries.


Photo credit Aron KleinKhalsa Aid International initiated a series of relief efforts to assist refugees in this area in May 2018 this has included:• Providing 3.2 tonnes of emergency food rations across four refugee camps.• Funding the operation and maintenance of  a water pump serving over 15,000 vulnerable refugees.• Providing resources to support two refugee schools.• Delivering vital walking aids to 28 physically challenged refugees.• Working to assess and improve nutritional status in refugee children arriving in  a reception centre.


Photo credit Aron KleinOur work in DRC has been coordinated with the UN refugee agency, the World Food Programme, International Red Cross, Red Crescent Movement , the Zambian Red Cross, and Medecins Sans Frontieres.  Khalsa Aid International has been able to respond to recognised  needs immediately. There are predicated to be further and larger refugee influxes in the coming months, Khalsa Aid international will endeavour to provide emergency, short term, food security where it is needed the most.

                        <p class="desc ng-binding">Bartella is a small Assyrian Orthodox Christian town in Northern Iraq. This town was devastated by ISIS during their campaign of terror - which included slayings, abductions and destruction of infrastructure – for two years. After ISIS was expelled from the town In October 2016 a team from Khalsa Aid International travelled to Bartella to assist with the recovery.&amp;nbsp;


A third of the town’s 3,000 residents were encouraged to return from nearby refugee camps. A local Assyrian community church which was retaken after being used as an ISIS training school. The church required electricity reconnection. The church is the hub of the community and restoring electric was a great morale boost for the community.


&amp;nbsp;Thanks to Khalsa Aid supporters, we were able to purchase a generator to the value of $15,000 for the church.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Throughout the mission, Khalsa Aid International worked closely with Father Jacob from the church. It was he who initially made a request for assistance, we were honoured to deliver a successful response.&amp;nbsp;</p>

This has devastated the yield of crops in the Southern regions, subjecting 1.2 million people to food insecurity and 400,000 more are in a critical state of famine. The World Food Programme has reported that this is the first ever famine caused solely by climate change and the effects are catastrophic. The United Nations have disclosed that mud, insects, clay and ashes are all being consumed in desperation to relieve chronic hunger. Cases of acute malnutrition are severe and in abundance.As of November 2021, we have established an operation for Madagascar Famine Relief. In association with Lion\u2019s Club District 417 and The Food Bank of Madagascar, we are delivering vital assistance in the deep South of the country.\n    \n        \nThe initial stage of this relief action initiative will be to deliver essential food products to families throughout the South. We are distributing to more than 200 families per day, providing each with the resources to sustain them for at least 2 weeks. We are solely purchasing from local suppliers in a deliberate effort to support the local economy and farming trade. Both of these industries have suffered greatly at the hands of climate change and the Covid-19 pandemic.Thank you for your donations which support this vital project.&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","project_date_created":"2021-11-17 00:00:00","project_date":"Nov 2021","country_name":"Madagascar","state_name":"Antananarivo","total_views":0,"created_on":"2022-01-06 14:56:47","project_complete":1,"updated_on":"2022-01-06 14:56:47","latitude":-22.2688,"longitude":46.0547,"is_read_more_added":1,"flag":"https:\/\/www.khalsaaid.org\/assets\/images\/flags\/mg.png"},{"project_id":46,"iso_code_2":"ID","project_name":"Indonesia Earthquake and Tsunami Relief","slug":"indonesia-earthquake-and-tsunami-relief-2018","project_image":"https:\/\/www.khalsaaid.org\/uploads\/projects\/1540306467_project_.jpg","small_description":"Indonesia \u2013 Earthquake and Tsunami ReliefA powerful earthquake ( 7.5 magnitude )  struck off the coast of Sulawesi, Indonesia, creating a  tsunami which devastated the  areas of Palu and Dongalla.
