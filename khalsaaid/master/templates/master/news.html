According to Mr. Madhukar, there is a\r\n    critical lack of awareness about these disappearances.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \u201c<em>Lapata. And the Left Behind.<\/em> aims to bring attention to this\r\n    largely untold story of human rights injustices and the lingering impact on\r\n    the families of loved ones who are still waiting for answers,\u201d said Mr.\r\n    Madhukar. \u201cThis story is yet another reminder \u2013 whether it\u2019s Yezidis,\r\n    Rohingya, Tibetans, Tamils, Kashmiris or Sikhs who suffered for decades \u2013\r\n    those who are left behind pay the heaviest price.

In August 2012, four new volunteers flew to Haiti to continue the aid program for the several orphanages which Khalsa Aid has been assisting since the deadly earthquake in January 2010. Then in September Dennis Darwent ( BAA employee ) and his son James also flew to Haiti to do the same. This father and son team managed to arrange an installation of a water pump in an orphanage which is located in a isolated area. Both of these teams also delivered over a ton of food to these orphanages. Khalsa Aid is very grateful to these wonderful people who took time out of their busy lives to serve humanity.","display_date":0,"display_time":0,"fb_shares":0,"tweet_shares":0,"header_type":0,"header_info":"https:\/\/www.khalsaaid.org\/uploads\/news\/1456468383.jpg","created_on":"03 Nov 2012","publish_date":"03 Nov 2012","created_timeago":"2012-11-03 23:30:00","status":1,"sort_order":76,"publish_time":"11 30 PM"},{"news_id":41,"is_read_more_added":0,"news_title":"100 Tons of Food Aid","small_description":"In 2011 Khalsa Aid worked very closely with the Sikh community of Kenya and delivered over 100 tons of food aid to the famine affected areas of north Kenya.
