                            In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Khalsa Aid International has been working around the clock on the emergency food appeal. We have been creating food packages for those most vulnerable in the community and unable to leave their homes.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We would like to express our gratitude to Circuit for granting us access to their fantastic route planning services. Our delivery drops are carried out by our amazing volunteers on the frontline. Through using Circuit, they have been able to achieve efficiency by selecting the most efficient route to deliver in a time-sensitive manner.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            The service has also ensured extremely accurate ETAs, which are invaluable when trying to reach as many vulnerable people as possible during the day. Working with a navigation of their own choice, our volunteers are continuing to deliver efficiently and professionally thanks to Circuit.
                        </p>

I started at the UK headquarters just a few days after my last job in Kathmandu, Nepal, ended - where I was working as a Disaster Relief Coordinator overseeing the construction of a school that had not been fully rebuilt since the notorious earthquake of 2015. Prior to that, I taught English as a volunteer in Thailand and Tanzania, and worked at a health charity in London.</p><div class="medium-insert-images"><figure>
<img src="{% static 'images/1540398154IMG_9969.jpg' %}" alt="">

</figure></div><p>I also recently completed two volunteer aid missions to Turkey with Khalsa Aid in 2018. The first was in January, where temperatures often dropped below freezing, and refugee camps saw intensive flooding. My team’s main aim was to provide food and fire wood to keep them warm during the winter months. We had just enough funding to aid 130 families with food, so we identified and delivered to those in the most desperate need. It was incredibly eye opening to see how we could deliver in such a short time – and how this truly happened thanks to the support of our donors.</p><div class="medium-insert-images"><figure>
<img src="{% static 'images/1540398165IMG_0151.jpg' %}" alt="">

</figure></div><p>The second trip was in May, when the weather was a lot nicer but loomed towards being ‘too hot’ in the summer months. During this trip we concentrated on providing more food packs to needed families, and also to ensure 300 mattresses were replaced for those that were damaged or lost during the winter flooding Each tent housed eight to ten refugees, meaning families would often take it in turns to sleep and use the mattresses.</p><p>I know I’ve just seen the surface of Khalsa Aid’s work, so I am looking forward to getting stuck in. Right now, I’m packing for a few months of travel and will be updating lots on my new Twitter account.</p><p>Feel free to follow me [Paps_KhalsaAid] and say hello!”</p>																										</div>

</figure></div><p class=""><b>Expressive Arts workshop for women and children returning from Isis capture.</b></p><p class="">It was an honour, a privilege and a heartbreak to learn more about the plight of the Yezidi community in Northern Iraq. Words cannot always truly capture the complexity of such trauma whereas art enabled a conversation about the experiences of the women and children returning from Isis capture in a more profound way.</p><p class="">In the Expressive Arts workshop, held at the Jinda centre in Duhok, the women were able to engage and support each other with the trauma that unraveled. The feedback from the women was that it was cathartic and it helped them rekindle a sense of creativity which has been lost since the conflicts. Common themes which emerged from the workshops were the appreciation of the beauty of life before genocide at Shingal as well as the loss of identity, control and humanity that has occurred.</p><p class="">I was present, bearing witness and attempting to offer support in the most simplest form and I was able to, in that space, observe one of the warmest and kindest groups of people I have had the privilege to meet. Only in being present did I see the extent of the physical, social and emotional destruction. Without these humanitarian projects, there is little attention to the aftermath and how people continue their lives with a continued sense of instability and conflict.</p><div class="medium-insert-images medium-insert-images-right"><figure>
<img src="{% static 'images/588685850e1b7.jpg' %}" alt="" class="">

</figure></div><p class="">Personally I aspire to continue supporting Khalsa Aid and the Jinda centre in whichever way possible. Part of this is maintaining the conversations of the community to raise awareness of the reality of the on going crises.</p><p class="">There is so much to say and not say, the layers in the experience are again at risk of being lost with words without the therapeutic richness of the feeling of being present. Overall I am humbled beyond thought for the seva and opportunity given.</p><p>If you have any thoughts around the Expressive Arts workshops or Art Therapy, I would be happy to discuss. Please contact Khalsa Aid for any questions or to donate.</p><p>Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa Waheguru Ji ki Fateh</p><p class="">Jaspal Kaur</p><p class=""><br></p><div class="medium-insert-images medium-insert-images-grid"><figure class="">

</figure></div><p class=""><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">I’ve always been a bit of a thrill seeker… but if you told me I’d be jumping out of plane this weekend I would have laughed in your face! Finding out that Skydiving was one of Khalsa Aid’s Annual Events, I couldn’t resist signing up. I was part of a group of some awesome volunteers who worked really hard to rally up a group of divers so we could raise as much money as possible to support Khalsa Aid’s ongoing work.</span></p><div class="medium-insert-images medium-insert-images-right"></div><p>Saturday was the perfect summers day for a skydive. It was heart warming to see so many people in their Khalsa Aid t-shirts and meeting lots of new people.. especially a bunch of Norwegians who had travelled all the way from Norway especially for the event. It was great to see lots of supporters who weren’t diving there too, including a few worried mums and reassuring friends.</p><p>The two gentleman from Langar Aid were absolutely fantastic! They were smiling from the beginning to the end of the day, ensuring everyone had a taste of their fresh, delicious cooking on site and bottles of water to keep us hydrated.</p><p class=""><br></p><p>I was amongst one of the last groups to dive, but the sense of camaraderie was epic! We even had time to blast some music and have a dance beside the airfield before we got kitted up in our super attractive skydiving gear. Personally, I think we all looked like Ghostbusters ready to take on the world, so absolutely loved every minute! Including the ground coming towards me at 120mph… but worry not! Kev the instructor was there to pull the parachute out and ensure a safe landing through a mist of blue skies and fluffy clouds :) </p><div class="medium-insert-images medium-insert-images-right"><figure>
<img src="{%  static 'images/14708284813.jpg' %}" alt="" class="">

</figure></div><p class=""><br></p><p>We all left the airfield that day having shared an amazing and unforgettable experience. Knowing that it was also for charity…for Khalsa Aid.. made it all the more amazing!</p><p>This experience gave me the opportunity to share my knowledge of Khalsa Aid’s work with friends, family and colleagues. People who had never heard of Khalsa Aid were fascinated about how volunteers were scattered across the most dangerous parts of the world to help those who needed it most. It was so nice to be able to tell my generous Assamese friend who donated to the cause that Khalsa Aid was in Assam right now helping with the floods. There's floods happening almost every year now, and the people of Assam need us. My Yemeni friend whose family are struggling in Yemen was one of the first to sign up to for the skydive because she was so grateful to Khalsa Aid for being one of the few charities to be actively working to help Yemen. A reminder that Khalsa Aid is really making a difference. </p><p>Much love and appreciation to all the supporters, volunteers, divers, family, friends and strangers that made all this happen.</p><p class=""><br></p><div class="medium-insert-images"><figure>

</figure></div><p>My sincere reflection -  I am grateful for the opportunity to have given some of my time and efforts to help a tragic situation. There are 65 million refugees in the world. Chios is the temporary home to approximately 2,000 of these. I had the opportunity to have conversations with some and learn their stories, What are they running from? What exactly went through their mind on the day they decided to flee? I'm not sure I was emotionally prepared for some of the answers I received. The unimaginable ultimatums that led to them pursuing this treacherous journey was so surreal to me.  Prior to this visit I was guilty of dehumanizing these refugees, these human beings. They are no different from you and me. Just like any population, I came across all different characters; quiet, loud, funny, rude. Different former professions; doctors, teachers, chemical engineers. All living in campsites, horrific conditions but for some, far better then the danger they have escaped. 'For me, this is heaven'  the words of a man fleeing for a sin punishable by death, being from a different faith (Christian).</p><div class="medium-insert-images medium-insert-images-grid"><figure>

</figure></div><p>A typical day volunteering included m<span style="line-height: 1.42857;">ornings of preparing lunch in the people's street kitchen supported by Khalsa Aid which was then distributed later in the day. After distributing the food to two campsites, I would stay at one of them to spend time with the kids. Evenings consisted of beach cleaning, sorting at the warehouse or helping pack food boxes for dinner. At night volunteers take it in turns to patrol the shores for boat landings.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">One day we organised a football match for the unaccompanied minors, a simple gesture; finding a pitch, a few goal posts, providing transport &amp; food.  The overwhelming level of gratitude we received was truly eye-opening. It meant so much to them because these kids have nothing or no one. I co-managed team Chios, and will forever be a die hard supporter #GoTeamChios.&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">The refugees are treated with compassion,    a humanity first mentality I truly support.</span></p><p>On closing reflection, I hope that the children in particular can have a brighter and safer future ahead of them. No one person on their own can solve this issue but if we all come together then a significant positive impact can be made.</p><p>Please donate &amp; support.</p><div class="medium-insert-images"><figure class="">

<img src="{% static 'images/1463065876FullSizeRender.jpg' %}" alt="" class="">

</figure></div><p class=""><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">I became a volunteer with Khalsa Aid after responding to a recruitment poster back in March this year.  I’d been following them on Facebook for some time and seeing the great work they’ve been doing, both at home (including my native Yorkshire during the recent floods) and overseas.  So I was thrilled to be invited along to their induction day.  Khalsa Aid, whilst a faith inspired charity, is open to everyone regardless of religion or background, and its values and ethics resonate strongly with me.  Those of recognising “the whole human race as one” and selfless service.</span></p><p> </p><p>I wanted to get involved as soon as I could and started by organising a Khalsa Aid bake day.  I’ve never worked in a place that didn’t like cake, so was off to a good start!  I had loads of support - help with baking cakes, and even more help with eating them.  One colleague spent an entire day baking and accompanied me with the trolley across several floors on bake day, handing out leaflets.  Most importantly, people were interested in the charity.  We managed to raise over £250 thanks to their generosity.</p><div class="medium-insert-images medium-insert-images-grid"><figure class="">

<img src="{% static 'images/14630656823.jpg' %}" alt="">

</figure></div><p>       </p><p> </p><p>Going along to the volunteer induction day in Slough, I got to meet Khalsa Aid members and fellow volunteers, new and old.  Ravi Singh (CEO) came to speak to us, having literally just landed back in London from working with the refugees in Iraq.  It was a very humbling experience, hearing about the history of the charity and all of their projects, as well as first-hand experiences of the volunteers.  We also took part in some group work, got to know one another over coffee and pizza, and discussed fundraising events.</p><p> </p><p>I’ve been blessed since then to be able to take part in two Khalsa Aid fundraising stalls.  My first opportunity as a volunteer was at the Gravesend Vaisakhi last month, which was my first time at a nagar kirtan event.  The team were all friendly and welcoming and, despite the cold weather, it was a great day.  As well as chatting to people at the stall and taking donations, we also headed out into the crowds later on, armed with leaflets, balloons (for the kids) and collection buckets.</p><div class="medium-insert-images medium-insert-images-left"><figure>
<img src="{% static 'images/14630659424.jpg' %}" alt="" class="">

</figure></div><p>A couple of weeks later, I was at Slough nagar kirtan and got to meet other members and volunteers this time.  I was again amazed by the generosity of the people there.  The atmosphere at these events and on the stall, is wonderful, and it’s also great to see how many people approach to praise the work of Khalsa Aid and to donate or offer to volunteer.  I’m extremely grateful to be able to be a part of this, and to be working alongside people who have such a passion for serving others and making a difference.</p><div class="medium-insert-images medium-insert-images-right"></div><p>     </p><p> </p><p class=""></p><p>            </p><p></p><p></p><p>At the time of writing this, I’m looking forward to our next big event which will be the sixth annual Snowdon hike this July 2nd.  It’s going to be a challenging but fun day, with fellow hikers joining from across the country.  In the run-up, I’ve set up a JustGiving page (<a href="https://www.justgiving.com/KA-Snowdon2016-RachelMorrison">https://www.justgiving.com/KA-Snowdon2016-RachelMorrison</a>) and am putting the word out, sharing the poster and encouraging my family and friends to come along.  I hope I'll see you there!</p><p class=""><br></p>																										</div>

Words cannot always truly capture the complexity of such trauma whereas art enabled a conversation about the experiences of the women and children returning from Isis capture in a more profound way.<\/p><p class=\"\">In the Expressive Arts workshop, held at the Jinda centre in Duhok, the women were able to engage and support each other with the trauma that unraveled. The feedback from the women was that it was cathartic and it helped them rekindle a sense of creativity which has been lost since the conflicts. Common themes which emerged from the workshops were the appreciation of the beauty of life before genocide at Shingal as well as the loss of identity, control and humanity that has occurred.<\/p><p class=\"\">I was present, bearing witness and attempting to offer support in the most simplest form and I was able to, in that space, observe one of the warmest and kindest groups of people I have had the privilege to meet. Only in being present did I see the extent of the physical, social and emotional destruction. Without these humanitarian projects, there is little attention to the aftermath and how people continue their lives with a continued sense of instability and conflict.<\/p><div class=\"medium-insert-images medium-insert-images-right\"><figure>\r\n    <img src=\"https:\/\/www.khalsaaid.org\/uploads\/blogs\/588685850e1b7.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"\">\r\n        \r\n<\/figure><\/div><p class=\"\">Personally I aspire to continue supporting Khalsa Aid and the Jinda centre in whichever way possible.

Words cannot always truly capture the complexity of such trauma whereas art enabled a conversation about the experiences of the women and children returning from Isis capture in a more profound way.In the Expressive Arts workshop, held at the Jinda centre in Duhok, the women were able to engage and support each other with the trauma that unraveled. The feedback from the women was that it was cathartic and it helped them rekindle a sense of creativity which has been lost since the conflicts. Common themes which emerged from the workshops were the appreciation of the beauty of life before genocide at Shingal as well as the loss of identity, control and humanity that has occurred.I was present, bearing witness and attempting to offer support in the most simplest form and I was able to, in that space, observe one of the warmest and kindest groups of people I have had the privilege to meet. Only in being present did I see the extent of the physical, social and emotional destruction. Without these humanitarian projects, there is little attention to the aftermath and how people continue their lives with a continued sense of instability and conflict.\r\n    \r\n        \r\nPersonally I aspire to continue supporting Khalsa Aid and the Jinda centre in whichever way possible. Part of this is maintaining the conversations of the community to raise awareness of the reality of the on going crises.There is so much to say and not say, the layers in the experience are again at risk of being lost with words without the therapeutic richness of the feeling of being present.
