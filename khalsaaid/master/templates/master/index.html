The donation to date has been used to buy 56 tonnes of\r\n                fruit and vegetables, equivalent to&nbsp;135,275 meals, for 256\r\n                charities and schools, serving people in need across 28\r\n                boroughs.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                The news comes as The Felix Project (London\u2019s largest food\r\n                redistribution charity), faces challenges to obtaining surplus\r\n                food supply due to ongoing UK-wide haulier issues.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Richard Smith, Supply Manager at The Felix Project, says: \u201cWe\r\n                are currently facing some challenges with hauliers due to\r\n                Brexit and lockdown, so being able to fill gaps in our surplus\r\n                supply is invaluable to our operation and the Londoners we\r\n                serve. With this donation from Khalsa Aid, we bought apples,\r\n                oranges, pears, grapes, onions and carrots. Donations like this\r\n                empower us to supply a constant and consistent level of food\r\n                for Londoners in need.\u201d\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Ravi Singh, Founder and CEO of Khalsa Aid International, says:\r\n                - \u201cKhalsa Aid International is proud to do what we can to help\r\n                feed London\u2019s hungry, where there is clearly a huge and growing\r\n                need for our support. We visited The Felix Project\u2019s depot in\r\n                West London and saw first-hand the quality of the food we\r\n                supplied. We are delighted with the partnership we have formed\r\n                with The Felix Project to help feed the homeless, the\r\n                vulnerable and the isolated in local communities. Feeding\r\n                people nutritious food is at the core of Khalsa Aid\u2019s work, in\r\n                line with the Sikh philosophy of \u2018seva\u2019 (meaning selfless\r\n                service to humanity). This is a natural extension to Khalsa\r\n                Aid\u2019s Langar Aid project based in Coventry (which has been\r\n                awarded The Queen\u2019s Award for Voluntary Service). By forming\r\n                the partnership with The Felix Project, Khalsa Aid has extended\r\n                its reach in feeding the hungry from The Midlands to London. I\r\n                envisage this is just the start of a long partnership to help\r\n                feed London\u2019s hungry.\u201d\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Ian Breen, from local charity Acton Homeless Concern, says: \u201cIt\r\n                was brilliant to get so much quality fruit and veg in our\r\n                recent delivery from Felix\/Khalsa Aid. Fresh food is really\r\n                important for our clients, who struggle to find that kind of\r\n                nutrition elsewhere.

The donation to date has been used to buy 56 tonnes of\n                fruit and vegetables, equivalent to&nbsp;135,275 meals, for 256\n                charities and schools, serving people in need across 28\n                boroughs.\n            <\/p>\n            <p>\n                The news comes as The Felix Project (London\u2019s largest food\n                redistribution charity), faces challenges to obtaining surplus\n                food supply due to ongoing UK-wide haulier issues.\n            <\/p>\n            <p>\n                Richard Smith, Supply Manager at The Felix Project, says: \u201cWe\n                are currently facing some challenges with hauliers due to\n                Brexit and lockdown, so being able to fill gaps in our surplus\n                supply is invaluable to our operation and the Londoners we\n                serve. With this donation from Khalsa Aid, we bought apples,\n                oranges, pears, grapes, onions and carrots. Donations like this\n                empower us to supply a constant and consistent level of food\n                for Londoners in need.\u201d\n            <\/p>\n            <p>\n                Ravi Singh, Founder and CEO of Khalsa Aid International, says:\n                - \u201cKhalsa Aid International is proud to do what we can to help\n                feed London\u2019s hungry, where there is clearly a huge and growing\n                need for our support. We visited The Felix Project\u2019s depot in\n                West London and saw first-hand the quality of the food we\n                supplied. We are delighted with the partnership we have formed\n                with The Felix Project to help feed the homeless, the\n                vulnerable and the isolated in local communities. Feeding\n                people nutritious food is at the core of Khalsa Aid\u2019s work, in\n                line with the Sikh philosophy of \u2018seva\u2019 (meaning selfless\n                service to humanity). This is a natural extension to Khalsa\n                Aid\u2019s Langar Aid project based in Coventry (which has been\n                awarded The Queen\u2019s Award for Voluntary Service). By forming\n                the partnership with The Felix Project, Khalsa Aid has extended\n                its reach in feeding the hungry from The Midlands to London. I\n                envisage this is just the start of a long partnership to help\n                feed London\u2019s hungry.\u201d\n            <\/p>\n            <p>\n                Ian Breen, from local charity Acton Homeless Concern, says: \u201cIt\n                was brilliant to get so much quality fruit and veg in our\n                recent delivery from Felix\/Khalsa Aid. Fresh food is really\n                important for our clients, who struggle to find that kind of\n                nutrition elsewhere.

This collaboration will help WFP to maintain\r\n    programmes that provide vulnerable children and women with the nutrition\r\n    they need to survive and thrive.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n    In Yemen, Khalsa Aid International\u2019s contribution will go towards WFP\u2019s\r\n    Healthy Kitchens programme, supporting collective kitchens that employ\r\n    vulnerable members of the community \u2013 80 per cent of whom are women \u2013 to\r\n    prepare fresh, healthy meals for almost 10,000 school children. The meals\r\n    are made with locally sourced ingredients and respect domestic food\r\n    culture, while also providing local producers with regular business.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n    In Sudan, the partnership will facilitate essential nutrition assistance to\r\n    refugees who have fled the Tigray crisis in neighbouring Ethiopia. This\r\n    assistance will help protect and support tens of thousands of individuals,\r\n    particularly children under five and pregnant and breastfeeding women who\r\n    are at risk of suffering from malnutrition.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \u201cThrough this partnership, we will reach more communities with more of what\r\n    they need most: food, help, and hope.

We\r\nare delighted with the partnership we have formed with WFP    <strong>, <\/strong>which builds on our previous humanitarian initiatives,\r\n    and have selected programmes that provide vulnerable children and women\r\n    with the nutrition they need to survive. Feeding people nutritious food is\r\nat the core of Khalsa Aid\u2019s work, in line with the Sikh philosophy of    <em>langar <\/em>(free community kitchen) and <em>seva<\/em> (meaning\r\n    selfless service to humanity), which is at the core of all our current\r\n    global programmes. Through this partnership, Khalsa Aid has further\r\n    extended its reach in feeding the hungry globally.
