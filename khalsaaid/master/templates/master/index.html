Donations like this\n                empower us to supply a constant and consistent level of food\n                for Londoners in need.\u201d\n            <\/p>\n            <p>\n                Ravi Singh, Founder and CEO of Khalsa Aid International, says:\n                - \u201cKhalsa Aid International is proud to do what we can to help\n                feed London\u2019s hungry, where there is clearly a huge and growing\n                need for our support. We visited The Felix Project\u2019s depot in\n                West London and saw first-hand the quality of the food we\n                supplied. We are delighted with the partnership we have formed\n                with The Felix Project to help feed the homeless, the\n                vulnerable and the isolated in local communities. Feeding\n                people nutritious food is at the core of Khalsa Aid\u2019s work, in\n                line with the Sikh philosophy of \u2018seva\u2019 (meaning selfless\n                service to humanity). This is a natural extension to Khalsa\n                Aid\u2019s Langar Aid project based in Coventry (which has been\n                awarded The Queen\u2019s Award for Voluntary Service). By forming\n                the partnership with The Felix Project, Khalsa Aid has extended\n                its reach in feeding the hungry from The Midlands to London. I\n                envisage this is just the start of a long partnership to help\n                feed London\u2019s hungry.\u201d\n            <\/p>\n            <p>\n                Ian Breen, from local charity Acton Homeless Concern, says: \u201cIt\n                was brilliant to get so much quality fruit and veg in our\n                recent delivery from Felix\/Khalsa Aid. Fresh food is really\n                important for our clients, who struggle to find that kind of\n                nutrition elsewhere. We are really grateful to The Felix\n                Project and Khalsa Aid International\u201d.\n            <\/p>\n\n            \n<p>\n<b>\n                The Felix Project\n            <\/b>\n<br>\n                The Felix Project is London's largest food redistribution\n                charity. We rescue good food that cannot be sold and deliver it\n                direct to charities and schools serving people in need. Our\n                vision is a London where no one goes hungry and good food is\n                never wasted. We are on a mission to deliver 38 million meals\n                this year.

It is home to a number of informal refugee camps, housing some of the three million refugees who have fled war torn Syria. The conditions in these make shift camps are very challenging and families are struggling to meet their basic needs. Following an assessment of these camps on New Year\u2019s Day 2017, Khalsa Aid International set up an emergency response.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n&nbsp;We are proud to have set up the following activities, helping countless refugees to better endure the remainder of an incredibly harsh winter that brought severe rainfall and hardship:- Buying and placing 1000 pallets to raise tents off and prevent flooding- Providing tarpaulin sheets to prevent rainwater entering makeshift tents- Giving firewood to meet significant needs for heating- Distributing 500 sanitary kits for women in need- Giving a month\u2019s supply of nappies for babies and toddlers- Working with a local charity to distribute winter food packs\r\n    \r\n        \r\nThanks to our supporters, we could serve the community with relief for three months of winter.This was warmly welcomed as the refugee population is often forgotten and unaided, simply because they reside on private land, which is hard to access.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","project_date_created":"2017-01-10 00:00:00","project_date":"Jan 2017","country_name":"Turkey","state_name":"Adana","total_views":0,"created_on":"2018-06-11 15:21:42","project_complete":1,"updated_on":"2018-06-11 15:21:42","latitude":38.1556,"longitude":27.3666,"is_read_more_added":1,"flag":"https:\/\/www.khalsaaid.org\/assets\/images\/flags\/tr.png"},{"project_id":41,"iso_code_2":"IQ","project_name":"Project Dignity: Essential Clothing for Yezidi women, ex slaves of ISIS","slug":"project-dignity","project_image":"https:\/\/www.khalsaaid.org\/uploads\/projects\/1531752790_project_.jpg","small_description":"Northern Iraq is home to the Yezidi community, one of the most vulnerable religious groups in the world. In 2014 ISIS targeted the Yezidis, killing the men, taking young boys as child soldiers and enslaving women and girls. Since 2016 Khalsa Aid International has been working with Yezidi girls and women who have returned from ISIS captivity, traumatised and with nothing but the clothes their captors had forced them to wear.\r\n    \r\n        \r\nPhoto credit: Nahwand JaffKhalsa Aid International has set up Project Dignity, thanks to our supporters. This has an innovative approach: to provide transport, an individual budget, and plenty of time for each Yezidi woman\/girl to choose her own set of clothes with support from our local staff. It is one of the last types of freedom one can imagine after months or years of violent oppression.Each trip also offers an opportunity to socialise with a group of women who have suffered from similar psychological trauma.&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n        \r\nPhoto credit: Savraj Kaur&nbsp;\"When I was in ISIS's hands, all I had to wear was black from head to toe.

It costs $50 to help a Yezidi woman with clothing.Your support is vital for all our projects.
